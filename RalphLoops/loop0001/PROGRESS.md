### Completed
- Item 01: imported sources and scaffolded the repo.
  - Copied `formdiscovery1.0/` from the Dropbox path to `matlab/formdiscovery1.0/`
    (74 `.m` files, `README.txt`, `data/` with 21 `.mat`/`.tar.gz` files plus `README.txt` and
    `.svnignore`). `diff -rq` against the source shows `octave-core` as the only difference;
    it was deleted.
  - Deleted the `MATLAB DO DANIEL/` tree (it contained only nested empty directories, no files).
  - Created `pyproject.toml` (package `formdiscovery`, src layout via setuptools, pytest config
    with `pythonpath = ["src"]`, `--strict-markers`, markers `slow` and `octave`),
    `environment.yml` (env `fd`, conda-forge, unpinned; pins come in item 02),
    `src/formdiscovery/__init__.py`, `tests/__init__.py`, `tests/octave/.gitkeep`,
    `tests/fixtures/.gitkeep`, `tools/.gitkeep`; extended `.gitignore` (results dirs,
    `_GtDout.dot`, `_LAYout.dot`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache`, `octave-core`, build dirs).
  - `python -m pytest -q` and `python -m pytest -q -m "not slow"` both exit 5 (no tests), as allowed in Phase 0.
- Note: the base Python has pytest 7.4.4, so `minversion` is set to 7.0 (not 8). The `fd`
  env built in item 02 will have a newer pytest.
- Note: the repo was already a git repo, so the `git init` step in PLAN §3.1 was not needed.
### Blockers
- None.
### Next
- Item 02: create conda env `fd` from `environment.yml` (octave, oct2py, pygraphviz), verify,
  write `tests/conftest.py` with the `octave` session fixture, and pin versions.
